This semester project, conducted within the context of the course 'Advanced Database Topics'
at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),
aims to provide familiarization with Big Data processing and analysis using the Apache Spark platform in an AWS Cloud environment.
Leveraging a dataset of Los Angeles crime records, the project examines the implementation of five (5) complex queries
covering trend analysis, geospatial processing using the Apache Sedona library, and the correlation of socioeconomic indicators.
Through a comparative evaluation of different Spark APIs (RDD, DataFrame, SQL) and Join Strategies,
as well as scalability experiments utilizing variable computational resources,
the study highlights the advantages of the Catalyst Optimizer and the importance of performance optimization in distributed systems.
